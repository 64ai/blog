## Introduction
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.
**A height-balanced binary tree** is a binary tree in which
the **depth** of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

```python:tree-node.py
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```
## Things you should know
### 1. Terminology in Tree Data Structure.
* **Neighbor**: A parent or child node.
* **Ancestor**: A node reachable by repeatedly proceeding from child to parent.
* **Descendant**: A node reachable by repeatedly proceeding from parent to child. Also known as a subchild.
* **Degree**: The number of children a node has. A leaf, by definition, has a degree of zero.
* **Degree of Tree**: The maximum degree of any node in the tree.
* **Distance**: The number of edges along the shortest path between two nodes.
* **Level**: The number of edges along the unique path between a node and the root node. This is the same as `depth`.
* **Width**: The number of nodes at a given level.
* **Breadth**: The number of leaves in the tree.
* **Forest**: A set of one or more disjoint trees.
* **Ordered Tree**: A rooted tree in which an ordering is specified for the children of each vertex.
* **Size of a Tree**: The total number of nodes in the tree.

## Solutions

### 1. Using DFS
You can use `DFS` to recursively determine whether subtrees(left, right) are balanced or not.
Once you find some node where `left_depth` and `right_depth` differ more than one,
you set `is_balanced` variable to `False`. 

```python:main.py
def balanced_binary_tree(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
    is_balanced = True

    def dfs(node: Optional[TreeNode]):
        nonlocal is_balanced

        if not node:
            return 0
        left_depth = dfs(node.left)
        right_depth = dfs(node.right)

        # It is unbalanced tree when the depth of the two subtrees differ more than one.
        if abs(left_depth - right_depth) > 1:
            is_balanced = False

        return max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1

    dfs(root)
    return is_balanced
```

### 2. Using DFS, but Better
You might be wondering, "Why continue traversing the tree if we've already discovered an imbalance?" 
That's a great point. As soon as we identify a node with unbalanced subtrees, there's no need to proceed further.
```python:main.py
def balanced_binary_tree(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
    def get_depth(node: Optional[TreeNode]):
        if not node:
            return 0
        left_depth = get_depth(node.left)
        right_depth = get_depth(node.right)

        # If either subtree is unbalanced or current node's subtrees differ by more than 1, return -1
        if left_depth == - 1 or right_depth == -1 or abs(left_depth - right_depth) > 1:
            return -1
        return max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1

    return get_depth(root) != -1
```
