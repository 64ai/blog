## Introduction
Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures,
return an array answer such that `answer[i]` is the number of days you have to wait
after the ith day to get a warmer temperature.
If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep `answer[i] == 0` instead.

## Solutions
### 1. Using stack
This solution uses a stack to efficiently find the number of days until a warmer temperature for each day in the input list.

```python:using_stack.py
def daily_temperatures(temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    stack = []
    answer = [0] * len(temperatures)
    for index, temperature in enumerate(temperatures):
        while stack and stack[-1][1] < temperature:
            idx, temp = stack.pop()
            answer[idx] = index - idx
        stack.append((index, temperature))
    return answer
```


### 2. Using stack, but faster
It turns out that you don't have to store both index and the corresponding item.
In this optimized solution, we use a stack to store only the indices of the days. This reduces memory usage since we can always retrieve the temperature using the index. 
This solution is nearly three times as fast as the previous one.

```python:iteration.py
def daily_temperatures(temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    stack = []
    answer = [0] * len(temperatures)
    for index, temperature in enumerate(temperatures):
        while stack and temperatures[stack[-1]] < temperature:
            last = stack.pop()
            answer[last] = index - last
    return answer
```
