## Introduction
You are given two binary trees `root1` and `root2`. 
Imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.
You need to merge the two trees into a new binary tree.
The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node.
Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of the new tree.
Return the merged tree.
Note: The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.

```python:tree-node.py
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

## Solutions

### 1. Using DFS
This solution uses DFS to merge two binary trees. 
The function dfs recursively traverses both trees, node by node, 
and creates a new tree where each node's value is the sum of the corresponding nodes' values from the input trees. 
If a node exists in one tree but not the other, its value is taken as `0` for the missing tree. 

```python:main.py
def merge_two_binary_trees(root1: Optional[TreeNode], root2: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
    def dfs(node1: Optional[TreeNode], node2: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not node1 and not node2:
            return None
        node1_value, node2_value = 0, 0
        if node1:
            node1_value = node1.val
        if node2:
            node2_value = node2.val

        left = dfs(node1.left if node1 else None, node2.left if node2 else None)
        right = dfs(node1.right if node1 else None, node2.right if node2 else None)

        return TreeNode(node1_value + node2_value, left, right)

    return dfs(root1, root2)
```

### 2. Using DFS, but better
This improved solution still uses DFS but with a more streamlined approach. 
Instead of handling each node's existence separately, 
it leverages Python's truthy/falsy evaluation to simplify the code. 

```python:main.py
def merge_two_binary_trees(root1: Optional[TreeNode], root2: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
    def dfs(node1: Optional[TreeNode], node2: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if node1 and node2:
            return TreeNode(node1.val + node2.val,
                            left=dfs(node1.left, node2.left),
                            right=dfs(node1.right, node2.right))
        else:
            return node1 or node2
    return dfs(root1, root2)
```
