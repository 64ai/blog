## Introduction
A tree is **an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path**. 
In other words,
any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.

Given a tree of n nodes labelled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array of n - 1 edges where `edges[i] = [a(i), b(i)]` indicates
that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes `a(i)` and `b(i)` in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree
as the `root`. When you select a node x as the `root`, the result tree has height `h`. Among all possible rooted trees,
those with minimum height (i.e. `min(h)`)  are called **minimum height trees** (MHTs).

Return a list of all MHTs' root labels. You can return the answer in any order.
(The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.)

## Solutions

### 1. "Trim the Leaves"

```python:main.py
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List


def minimum_height_trees(n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    if n == 1:
        return [0]
    
    # Build the graph
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for source, dest in edges:
        graph[source].append(dest)
        graph[dest].append(source)
    
    # Initialize the first layer of leaves
    leaves = [i for i in range(n) if len(graph[i]) == 1]
    
    remaining_nodes = n
    while remaining_nodes > 2:
        remaining_nodes -= len(leaves)
        new_leaves = []
        
        # Remove the current leaves along with the edges
        for leaf in leaves:
            neighbor = graph[leaf].pop()
            graph[neighbor].remove(leaf)
            
            # If the neighbor has become a leaf, add it to the new leaves
            if len(graph[neighbor]) == 1:
                new_leaves.append(neighbor)
        
        leaves = new_leaves
    
    # The remaining nodes are the roots of MHTs
    return leaves
```
