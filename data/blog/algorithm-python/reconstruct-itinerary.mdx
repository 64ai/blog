## Introduction
You are given a list of airline tickets where `tickets[i]` = [$$from_i$$, $$to_i$$] represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it.

All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from `"JFK"`, thus, the itinerary must begin with `"JFK"`. 
If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the **smallest lexical order** when read as a single string.

For example, the itinerary `["JFK", "LGA"]` has a smaller lexical order than `["JFK", "LGB"]`.
You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. 
You must use all the tickets **once and only once**.

## Things you should know
### 1. sorting a nested list
By default, if you call `sorted` function with a nested list, it sorts the list by the first element of each entry. You can always change the sorting criteria by providing `key` parameter
```python:main.py
# Sorting a Nested List by the First Element
nested_list = [[2, 3], [1, 4]]
sorted_nested_list = sorted(nested_list)
print(sorted_nested_list)  # Output: [[1, 4], [2, 3]]

# Sorting a Nested List by the Second Element
nested_list = [[2, 3], [1, 4]]
sorted_nested_list = sorted(nested_list, key=lambda x: x[1])
print(sorted_nested_list)  # Output: [[2, 3], [1, 4]]
```
## Solutions
### 1. Using DFS(recursion)
This DFS solution reconstructs the itinerary by building a graph from the tickets and recursively visiting each airport. 
It starts at `'JFK'` and continues to visit destinations in lexicographical order. 
The final itinerary is obtained by reversing the list of visited airports.

The `pop(0)` operation can take $$O(n)$$ time, so it might be better to use a `deque` or to sort the destinations in reverse order from the start.

```python:main.py
def reconstruct_itinerary(tickets: List[List[str]]) -> List[str]:
    flights = defaultdict(list)

    for origin, destination in sorted(tickets):
        flights[origin].append(destination)

    itinerary = []

    def dfs(airport):
        while flights[airport]:
            dfs(flights[airport].pop(0))
        itinerary.append(airport)

    dfs('JFK')

    return itinerary[::-1]
```

### 2. Using a stack
You can also solve the problem without recursion. Make sure to reverse the `itinerary` at the end because the last airport with no further destinations will be added first in the list.
```python:main.py
def reconstruct_itinerary(tickets: List[List[str]]) -> List[str]:
    flights = defaultdict(list)

    itinerary, stack = [], ["JFK"]
    for origin, destination in sorted(tickets):
        flights[origin].append(destination)

    while stack:
        while flights[stack[-1]]:
            stack.append(flights[stack[-1]].pop(0))
        itinerary.append(stack.pop())
    return itinerary[::-1]
```
