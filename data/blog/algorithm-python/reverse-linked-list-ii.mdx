## Introduction
Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where `left <= right`, reverse the nodes of the list from position `left` to position `right`, and return the reversed list.

## Solutions

### 1. Using recursion
To reverse a linked list using recursion, we create a function named `reverse`. This function takes two parameters: `node`, the current node being processed, and `prev`, which points to the previous node. We start the recursion from the `head` of the list and call the `reverse()` function recursively.

Here's the implementation:


```python:recursion.py
def reverse_linked_list_ii(head: Optional[ListNode], left: int, right: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    # If the list is empty or the left and right positions are the same, no changes are needed
    if not head or (left == right):
        return head

    # 'root' is a dummy node that references the very beginning of the list
    # 'start' node will be a node that points to the first node being reversed.
    root = start = ListNode(None)
    root.next = head

    # Move 'start' to the node immediately before the reversal starts
    for _ in range(left - 1):
        start = start.next

    # 'end' will point to the first node to be reversed.
    # 'end' will be named as such because it will literally be the 'end' of reversed list
    end = start.next

    # Perform the reversal between 'left' and 'right'
    for _ in range(right - left):
        moving = end.next
        end.next = moving.next
        moving.next = start.next
        start.next = moving
    return root.next
```
