## Introduction
Given a linked list, determine whether it forms a palindrome. In the context of a linked list, this means that the values of the nodes are symmetrical when read from the beginning to the end and from the end to the beginning.
The interface is described below.
```python:list_node.py
from typing import Optional

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next: Optional['ListNode']=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

# This will form a linked list where the order is 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1
fourth = ListNode(val=1)
third = ListNode(val=2, next=fourth)
second = ListNode(val=2, next=third)
first = ListNode(val=1, next=second)
```

## Things you should know
### 1. Runner Technique

The **runner technique** is a common approach used in linked list problems to efficiently solve problems involving linked lists, especially for tasks like detecting cycles, finding midpoints, or solving **_palindrome-related problems_**. It involves using two pointers that traverse the list at different speeds: one pointer moves one node at a time (the `slow` pointer), while the other moves two nodes at a time (the `fast` pointer).

## Solutions
Iterate through the linked list, append each node value(`node.val`) in the deque.  

### 1. Naïve solution
Though this solution gets the job done in **$$O(n)$$** , it seems a little bit hacky, doesn't it?
```python:using_deque.py
from typing import Optional, Deque
from collections import deque


def palindrome_linked_list(head: ListNode) -> bool:
    q: Deque = deque()  # used deque because popleft() 
    node = head
    while node is not None:
        q.append(node.val)
        node = node.next
    while len(q) > 1:
        if q.popleft() != q.pop():
            return False
    return True
```

### 2. Using the runner technique
Pushing elements into the first half of the linked list, and then comparing it with the second half.
```python:runner_technique.py
from typing import Optional

# Definition for singly-linked list.
def palindrome_linked_list(head: ListNode) -> bool:
    # Use the runner technique to push the first half of the list onto a stack
    while fast and fast.next:
        stack.append(slow.val)
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    
    # If the list has an odd number of nodes, skip the middle node
    if fast:
        slow = slow.next
    
    # Compare the second half of the list with the elements in the stack
    while slow:
        if slow.val != stack.pop():
            return False
        slow = slow.next
    
    return True
```
