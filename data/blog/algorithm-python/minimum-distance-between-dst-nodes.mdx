## Introduction
Given the `root` of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum difference between the values of **any two different nodes** in the tree.

## Solutions
### 1. Using DFS(Recursion)
This solution uses a recursive in-order traversal to find the minimum distance between nodes in the BST. 
In-order traversal ensures that nodes are processed in sorted order.
```python:main.py
def minimum_distance_between_bst_nodes(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
    answer = float('int')
    prev = -float('int') # Initialize to negative infinity to handle first node comparison

    def in_order_traverse(node: Optional[TreeNode]):
        nonlocal answer, prev
        if node:
            # Traverse left subtree
            in_order_traverse(node.left)
            
            # Update the minimum difference
            answer = min(answer, node.val - prev)
            
            # Update previous node value
            prev = node.val
            
            # Traverse right subtree
            in_order_traverse(node.right)

    in_order_traverse(root)
    return int(answer)
```

### 2. Using DFS(Stack)
This solution uses an iterative in-order traversal with a stack to find the minimum distance between nodes in the BST. 
This approach avoids recursion by using a stack to simulate the call stack.
```python:main.py
def minimum_distance_between_bst_nodes(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
    answer = float('inf')
    prev = -float('inf')
    stack = []
    node = root
    while stack or node:
        while node:
            stack.append(node)
            node = node.left
        node = stack.pop()
        answer = min(answer, node.val - prev)
        prev = node.val
        node = node.right

    return answer
```
