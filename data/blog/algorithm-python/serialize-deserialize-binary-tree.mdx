## Introduction
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be
stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in
the same or another computer environment. Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There
is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a
binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not
necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

```python:tree-node.py
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

## Things you should know
### 1. Mapping binary tree to list

![Phone Keypad](/static/images/algorithm/binary-tree-array-representation.png)
When mapping a binary tree to a list, you generally skip the first index (`0`).
This is done because it makes it easier to calculate the indices of parent and child nodes.
Specifically, for a node at index `i`:
    - The left child is at index `2*i`
    - The right child is at index `2*i + 1`

## Solutions

### 1. Using BFS
In this solution, we leverage the BFS algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. 
The `deque` from Python's collections module is used to efficiently manage the nodes during both processes. 
Below is the complete implementation:

Note that in my solution, empty nodes(literally nodes that do not exist) are serialized into the string `#`. You can choose whatever character you'd like.

```python:main.py
class Codec:
    def serialize(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> str:
        # Initialize deque with root node.
        queue = deque([root])

        # 'result' has one dummy entry to skip the first index.
        result = ['#']
        
        # Perform BFS to serialize the tree.
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            if node:
                # Append left and right children to the queue.
                queue.append(node.left)
                queue.append(node.right)

                # Append current node value to the result.
                result.append(str(node.val))
            else:
                # Append '#' to the result if the node is None.
                result.append('#')
        
        # Join all elements in the result list with a space and return as string.
        return ' '.join(result)

    def deserialize(self, data: str) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        # Edge case: if data is empty or only contains the root placeholder.
        if not data or data == '# #':
            return None
        
        # Split the data string into a list of node values.
        nodes = data.split()
        
        # Initialize the root node with the value at index 1.
        root = TreeNode(int(nodes[1]))
        
        # Initialize a queue with the root node.
        queue = deque([root])
        
        # Start from index 2 since index 0 is a dummy and index 1 is the root.
        index = 2

        # Perform BFS to deserialize the tree.
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()

            # Process the left child.
            if index < len(nodes) and nodes[index] != '#':
                node.left = TreeNode(int(nodes[index]))
                queue.append(node.left)
            index += 1

            # Process the right child.
            if index < len(nodes) and nodes[index] != '#':
                node.right = TreeNode(int(nodes[index]))
                queue.append(node.right)
            index += 1

        # Return the reconstructed root node.
        return root
```
