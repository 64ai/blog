summary: 'Find two element index where sum of two elements equals to the target'
---

## Introduction
You will be given a list of number and the target.  
Find two element index where sum of two elements equals to the target.  
You can assume there is `always` one answer.
See example below.
```python
assert naive_two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9) == [0, 1]
assert naive_two_sum([3, 2, 4], 6) == [1, 2]
assert naive_two_sum([3, 3], 6) == [0, 1]
```

## Things you should know
### 1. enumerate function
The `enumerate()` function in Python takes an iterable (**not necessarily a list**) and returns an enumerate object. Each element of the enumerate object contains a tuple in the format of (index, original_item), where index represents the position of the item in the iterable, and original_item is the actual element from the iterable.
```python:enumerate.py
people = ['alex', 'sam', 'julia', 'tom', 'joe']

for index, person in enumerate(people):
    print(index, person)

# result
# 0 alex
# 1 sam
# 2 julia
# 3 tom
# 4 joe
```
## Solutions

### 1. Naïve one (brute force)
Well.. You can do it better for sure, can't you?
```python:main.py
def naive_two_sum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    for i, num1 in enumerate(nums):
        for j, num2 in enumerate(nums):
            if i == j:
                continue
            if num1 + num2 == target:
                return [i, j]
    return []
```

### 2. Slightly improved one
This method is more than twice as fast as the first one because `in` operator is faster than traversing each element in the list. But time complexity is still **$$O(n^2)$$**, though.
```python:main.py
def two_sum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in nums[i + 1:]:
            return [i, nums[i + 1:].index(complement) + i + 1]

    return []
```

### 3. Hash mapping
You can optimize for speed by trading off a bit of memory space. One approach is to store the difference (`diff`) between the target and each element along with its corresponding position (index).  
Then, while iterating through the list, you can check if the current element's complement (i.e., the difference) exists in the mapping.  
Finally, time complexity is **$$O(n)$$**.

```python:main.py
def two_sum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    mapping = dict()
    for index, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in mapping:
            if mapping[complement] != index:
                return [index, mapping[complement]]
        else:
            mapping[num] = index

    return []
```
