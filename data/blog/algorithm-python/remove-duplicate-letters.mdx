## Introduction
Given a string `s`, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is 
the smallest in **lexicographical** order among all possible results. `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Things you should know
### 1. all about 'set'
```python:set.py
# Creating an Empty Set
empty_set = set()
print(empty_set)  # Output: set()

# Creating a Set from a List with Duplicate Elements
duplicate_list_set = set([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5])
print(duplicate_list_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Creating a Set from a String
string_set = set("hello")
print(string_set)  # Output: {'h', 'e', 'l', 'o'}

# Creating a Set from a Tuple
tuple_set = set((1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
print(tuple_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Adding an Element to a Set
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
my_set.add(4)
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}

# Removing an Element from a Set
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
my_set.remove(2)
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 3}

# Checking Membership
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
print(2 in my_set)  # Output: True
print(4 in my_set)  # Output: False

# Set Union
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}
union_set = set1.union(set2)
print(union_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Set Intersection
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}
intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)
print(intersection_set)  # Output: {3}

# Set Difference
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}
difference_set = set1.difference(set2)
print(difference_set)  # Output: {1, 2}

# Set Symmetric Difference:
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}
symmetric_difference_set = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)
print(symmetric_difference_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}

# Removing an Element with Discard (No Error if Element Not Present)
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
my_set.discard(2)
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 3}
my_set.discard(4)  # No error, even though 4 is not in the set
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 3}

# Set Comprehension
my_set = {x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0}
print(my_set)  # Output: {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}

# Set Equivalence
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}
print(set1 == set2) # Output: True
```

## Solutions
### 1. Using set
This solution uses the set data structure to remove duplicate letters 
from the input string. The function recursively removes duplicates from the suffix and concatenates the current character to build the result string. 


```python:using_stack.py
def remove_duplicate_letters(s: str) -> str:
    # Iterate through each character in the sorted set of characters from the string
    for char in sorted(set(s)):
        # Find the suffix of the string starting from the first occurrence of the character
        suffix = s[s.index(char):]

        # If the set of characters in the original string is the same as the set in the suffix
        # This ensures that all unique characters of the original string are present in the suffix
        if set(s) == set(suffix):
            # Recursively call the function to remove duplicates, concatenating the current character
            # The character is replaced with an empty string in the suffix to avoid repetition
            return char + remove_duplicate_letters(suffix.replace(char, ''))

    # Return an empty string if the input string is empty
    return ''
```


### 2. Using stack
This algorithm uses a stack to construct the result string while ensuring that 
the letters are in lexicographical order and appear only once.


```python:iteration.py
from collections import Counter

def remove_duplicate_letters(s: str) -> str:
    # Create a counter to count the occurrences of each character in the string
    counter, seen, stack = Counter(s), set(), []

    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for char in s:
        # Decrease the count of the current character in the counter
        counter[char] -= 1
        
        # If the character is already in the seen set, skip it
        if char in seen:
            continue

        # While the stack is not empty, and the current character is smaller than the last character in the stack
        # and the last character in the stack still appears later in the string (i.e., its count is greater than 0)
        while stack and char < stack[-1] and counter[stack[-1]] > 0:
            # Remove the last character from the stack and from the seen set
            seen.remove(stack.pop())

        # Add the current character to the stack and mark it as seen
        stack.append(char)
        seen.add(char)
    
    # Join the characters in the stack to form the final result string
    return ''.join(stack)
```
