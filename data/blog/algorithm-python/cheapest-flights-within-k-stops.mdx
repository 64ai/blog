summary: 'Given an integer array nums of unique elements, return all possible cheapest Flights within k Stops (the power set). The solution set must not contain duplicate cheapest Flights within k Stops. Return the solution in any order.'

## Introduction
There are `n` cities connected by some number of flights.
You are given an array flights where `flights[i] = [from(i), to(i), price(i)]` indicates
that there is a flight from city `from(i)` to city `to(i)` with cost `price(i)`.

You are also given three integers `src`, `dst`, and `k`, _return **the cheapest price** from `src` to `dst` with at most `k` stops_.
If there is no such route, return `-1`.

## Solutions
### 1. Using Dijkstra's algorithm


```python:main.py
from heapq import heappush, heappop
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List


def cheapest_flights_within_k_stops(n: int, flights: List[List[int]], src: int, dst: int, k: int) -> int:
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for from_city, to_city, price in flights:
        graph[from_city].append((to_city, price))

    priority_queue = [(0, src, k + 1)]  # (current_cost, current_city, remaining_stops)

    while priority_queue:
        current_cost, current_city, remaining_stops = heappop(priority_queue)

        if current_city == dst:
            return current_cost

        if remaining_stops > 0:
            for next_city, price in graph[current_city]:
                heappush(priority_queue, (current_cost + price, next_city, remaining_stops - 1))

    return -1
```
