## Introduction
Given a list of integers, return a new list where each element is the product of all elements in the original list except for the element at the same index.  
You **must not** use division(`/`) operator.  Optimize your algorithm so that the time complexity is **$$O(n)$$** 

## Things you should know
### 1. creating a list of size n with every element being k
While you can use `range()` and append the desired number of elements to the list, there's a simpler way to achieve this.
```python:main.py
# making a list of size 10 where every element is 3
example1 = [3] * 10

# making a list of size 5 where every element is 1
example2 = [1] * 5
```

## Solutions
Remember, you cannot use division, and simply iterating through the list and multiplying each item won't satisfy the time complexity requirement.
For example, when `[1, 2, 3, 4]` is given. The answer should be `[24, 12, 8, 6]`.  
Let's see how we can solve this problem.

### 1. dividing left and right parts
1. first element: `2(right) * 3(right) * 4(right)`. all of them are at the right side of `1`.
2. second element: `1(left) * 3(right) * 4(right)`. 
3. third element: `1(left) * 2(left) * 4(right)`. 
4. fourth element: `1(left) * 2(left) * 3(left)`. all of them are at the left side of `4`.

```python:main.py
from typing import List


def product_of_array_except_self(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # initialize the answer list to which we will multiply
    answer = [1] * len(numbers)

    multiplier = 1

    # multiply left side elements first
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        answer[i] *= multiplier
        multiplier *= numbers[i]

    # resetting the multiplier
    multiplier = 1

    # and then multiply right side elements
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1, -1, -1):
        answer[i] *= multiplier
        multiplier *= numbers[i]

    return answer
```
