## Problem
You are given a string and a list of banned words. Find the most frequent word in the list except for the words that are in the banned list.

## Things you should know
### 1. List Comprehension
[List Comprehension](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_comprehension.asp) is arguably one of the most powerful features of the Python language.

```python:main.py
# finding a list of jobs with names consisting of more than one word.
jobs = ['fire fighter', 'police officer', 'software engineer', 'lawyer', 'teacher']
filtered = []

for job in jobs:
    if len(job.split(' ')) > 1:
        filtered.append(job)

# you can also use 'filter'. make sure to do the type conversion(to list).
filtered = list(filter(lambda x: len(x.split(' ')) > 1, jobs))

# done easier and more compact with the list comprehension
filtered = [job for job in jobs if len(job.split(' ')) > 1]
```

### 2. Counter object
Utilize the `collections.Counter` function instead of reinventing the wheel.  
This function conveniently stores the frequency of each element, eliminating the need for custom implementations.  
The most popular and useful method is `counter.most_common()`. You can specify the number of items you need by using the `n` parameter

```python:counter.py
from collections import Counter

counter = Counter(['a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'a', 'b'])

print(counter.most_common()) # [('a', 3), ('b', 2), ('c', 1)]
print(counter.most_common(n=1)) # [('a', 3)]
```

### 3. Python typings
Python is famous for its dynamic typing, allowing flexibility in variable assignment without explicit type declarations.  
However, starting from Python 3.7, developers can leverage the benefits of a gradually-improving type system, thanks to the introduction of optional type hints.   
This enhancement gives you better readability, improved code hint in IDEs.  
Here are some of the basic examples using `typing`

```python:typing.py
from typing import List, Dict

def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(result)  # Output: Hello, Alice!

names: List[str] = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
scores: Dict[str, int] = {"Alice": 85, "Bob": 90, "Charlie": 80}
```

## Solutions
```python:main.py
def most_common_word(paragraph: str, banned: List[str]):
    chunks = re.sub(r'[^A-Za-z]+', ' ', paragraph).lower().split(' ')
    counter = Counter([word for word in chunks if word not in banned and word != ''])

    return counter.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
