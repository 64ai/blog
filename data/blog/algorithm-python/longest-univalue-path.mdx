## Introduction
Given the `root` of a binary tree, _return **the length of the longest path**, where each node in the path has the same value._
This path may or may not pass through the root.
**The length of the path** between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

```python:tree-node.py
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

## Solutions

### 1. Using DFS
This solution finds the longest path in a binary tree where all nodes in the path have the same value.
It traverses each node to determine the longest sequence of connected nodes with identical values.


```python:main.py
def longest_univalue_path(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
    if not root:
        return 0

    max_length = 0

    def dfs(node: TreeNode) -> int:
        nonlocal max_length
        if not node:
            return 0

        left_path = dfs(node.left)
        right_path = dfs(node.right)

        if node.left and node.left.val == node.val:
            left_path += 1
        else:
            left_path = 0
        if node.right and node.right.val == node.val:
            right_path += 1
        else:
            right_path = 0

        max_length = max(max_length, left_path + right_path)
        return max(left_path, right_path)

    dfs(root)
    return max_length
```
