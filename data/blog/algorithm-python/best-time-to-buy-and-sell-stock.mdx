## Introduction
Given a list of integers, return a new list where each element is the product of all elements in the original list except for the element at the same index.

## Things you should know
### 1. maximum value
There are a few ways to indicate that a value is very large. `math.inf` and `float('inf')` can be used to express the concept of infinity. These values will always be greater than any literal `int` value.
```python:inf.py
import math


print(math.inf)  # inf
print(float('inf'))  # inf
print(math.inf * 2)  # inf
print(math.inf * -1)  # -inf
print(math.inf + 1 > math.inf)  # True
print(math.inf == float('inf'))  # True
```
Whereas `sys.maxsize` literally represents the maximum size of an int. If your machine is 64-bit, it will be the same as `2 ** 63 - 1`. On a 32-bit machine, it will be `2**31-1`. You should notice that `math.inf` is always greater than `sys.maxsize`.

```python:maxsize.py
import sys


print(sys.maxsize)  # 9223372036854775807
print(sys.maxsize == (2**63 - 1))  # True
print(float('inf') > sys.maxsize)  # True
```
## Solutions
### 1. Brute force
Well, You can always try the easiest approach and optimize from there. Time complexity is **$$O(n^2)$$** 
```python:main.py
from typing import List


def best_time_to_buy_and_sell_stock(prices: List[int]) -> int:
    profit = 0
    for i in range(len(prices)):
        # skip when found the same value.
        if i > 0 and prices[i] >= prices[i - 1]:
            continue
        for j in range(i, len(prices)):
            profit = max(profit, prices[j] - prices[i])
    return profit
```

### 2. update minimum then calculate maximum (Greedy algorithm)
It turns out, you can keep updating the local minimum and compare the maximum profit while iterating through the list. Time complexity is **$$O(n)$$** 
```python:main.py
import math
from typing import List


def best_time_to_buy_and_sell_stock(prices: List[int]) -> int:
    minimum = math.inf
    profit = 0
    for price in prices:
        minimum = min(minimum, price)
        profit = max(profit, price - minimum)
    return profit
```
