summary: 'Given an integer array nums of unique elements, return all possible course Schedule (the power set). The solution set must not contain duplicate course Schedule. Return the solution in any order.'

## Introduction
There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. 
You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [a(i), b(i)]` indicates that you **must** take course `b(i)` first if you want to take course `a(i)`.

For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.
Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.


## Solutions
### 1. Using DFS(recursion)
This solution detects cycles in the course-prerequisites relationship. 
To identify a cycle, it recursively calls the `dfs` function. 
For efficiency, it stores nodes that have already been visited in the `visited` set.

```python:main.py
def can_finish(num_courses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    course_graph = defaultdict(list)

    for course, prerequisite in prerequisites:
        course_graph[prerequisite].append(course)

    # courses being traced to detect a cycle.
    traced = set()

    # courses already visited.
    visited = set()

    def dfs(course):
        if course in traced:
            return False
        if course in visited:
            return True

        traced.add(course)

        # Process all the next courses that depend on the current course
        for next_course in course_graph[course]:
            if not dfs(next_course):
                return False

        traced.remove(course)
        visited.add(course)

        return True

    # Check each course in the graph
    for course in range(num_courses):
        if course in course_graph and not dfs(course):
            return False

    return True
```
