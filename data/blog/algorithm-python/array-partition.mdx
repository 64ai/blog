## Introduction
Find the maximum sum of pairs (a, b) where the minimum of (a, b) is maximized.

## Solutions
To maximize the sum, sorting the numbers in ascending order is beneficial, as it ensures that the larger values are paired together, potentially yielding a higher sum.
### 1. Naïve solution
```python:main.py
from typing import List


def array_partition(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    numbers.sort()
    answer = 0

    for i in range(0, len(numbers), 2):
        answer += min(numbers[i], numbers[i + 1])
    return answer
```

### 2. With a little trick
Did you catch that? In a sorted list, `min(a, b)` always picks up the first one.  
Therefore, you can skip the comparison part and simply pick the first number.

```python:main.py
from typing import List


def array_partition(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    numbers.sort()
    answer = 0

    for i in range(0, len(numbers), 2):
        answer += numbers[i]
    return answer
```

### 3. "Pythonic way"
Look at the elegance and simplicity of this solution, the beauty of `Pythonic` coding practices.  
This concise approach elegantly extracts every other element from the sorted list and sums them effortlessly.

```python:main.py
from typing import List


def array_partition(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(sorted(numbers[::2]))
```
