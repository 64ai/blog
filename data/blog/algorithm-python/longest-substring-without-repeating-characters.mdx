summary: 'Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.'

## Introduction
Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without **repeating characters**.

## Solutions
It utilizes a [sliding window approach](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/window-sliding-technique/) with a dictionary to track the last seen position of each character. 
The `start` variable marks the starting index of the current window, while `max_length` stores the length of the longest substring found so far. 
As the function iterates through the string, it adjusts the window based on whether the current character is already seen within the window. 
Finally, it returns the maximum length found.
### 1. Using Hashmap
```python:main.py
def longest_substring_without_repeating_characters(s: str) -> int:
    seen = {}
    start = 0
    max_length = 0
    for index, char in enumerate(s):
        if char in seen and start <= seen[char]:
            start = seen[char] + 1
        else:
            max_length = max(max_length, index - start + 1)
        seen[char] = index
    return max_length
```
