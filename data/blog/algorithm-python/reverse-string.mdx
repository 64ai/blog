## Introduction
reversing a string can be tricky in other programming languages. Let's see how easy and efficeint can this operation be in Python.

## Problem
Write a function that reverses a list of characters. You have to manipulate the original string withoout any `return` statement.

## Things you should know
### Two pointers technique
Assume there is a variable, that indicates a position(index) in a list or an array.  
You can call this variable a `pointer`, because this variable can be viewed as 'pointing' to a certain element in a list.  
Obviously, in 'two pointers technique', there are two variables that stores positions of a list.  
You can manipulate these variables for various tasks.

### Swapping values of two variables
Instead of introducing a temporary variable, you can directly exchange values of multiple variables like this.
```python:main.py
a = 1
b = 2

a, b = b, a

print(a) # 2
print(b) # 1
```

## Solutions
### 1. Two pointers

```python:main.py
from typing import List


def reverse_string(s: List[str]) -> None:
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1
```

### 2. Pythonic way

```python:main.py
from typing import List


def reverse_string(s: List[str]) -> None:
    s.reverse()
```
