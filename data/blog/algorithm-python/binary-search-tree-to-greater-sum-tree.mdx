## Introduction
Given the `root` of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Sum Tree 
such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

## Solutions
### 1. Using DFS(reverse in-order)
To solve the problem of converting a BST to a Greater Sum Tree (GST), 
we need to transform each node's value to be the sum of its original value plus the sum of all node values greater than the original value in the BST. 
This can be efficiently done using a `reverse in-order traversal` (right-root-left), as this ensures that we visit nodes in decreasing order of their values.

```python:main.py
def bst_to_gst(root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
    def dfs(node: TreeNode, acc=0):
        if not node:
            return acc
        # Traverse the right subtree first
        acc = dfs(node.right, acc)

        # Update the current node's value with the accumulated sum
        acc += node.val
        node.val = acc

        # Traverse the left subtree
        acc = dfs(node.left, acc)
        return acc

    dfs(root)
    return root
```
