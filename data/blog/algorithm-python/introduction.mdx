## Introduction
Would you like to deep-dive into the world of `AI/ML`? I do.  
But before getting your hands dirty, there are some prerequisites that you must have under the belt.  
Mathematics, Statistics, Probability theory, Python, ...etc. You name it.  

For now, among these things above, I would like to focus on Python.  
In this series, I'm going to solve some of the coding exercises curated in the book [파이썬 알고리즘 인터뷰(Python Algorithm Interview)](https://www.aladin.co.kr/shop/wproduct.aspx?ItemId=245495826)  
I will be trying to be as consistent as possible. Are you ready? let's go!
