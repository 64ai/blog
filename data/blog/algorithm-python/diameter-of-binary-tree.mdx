## Introduction
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the length of the **diameter** of the tree_.
The **diameter** of a binary tree is the **length** of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. 
This path may or may not pass through the `root`.
The **length** of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

```python:tree-node.py
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

## Solutions

### 1. Using DFS

This solution uses DFS to traverse all the nodes in the binary tree until it reaches the leaf nodes.
At each step, it recursively computes the depth of the `left` and `right` subtrees and updates the maximum diameter accordingly.

```python:main.py
def diameter_of_binary_tree(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
    max_length = 0

    def dfs(node: TreeNode):
        nonlocal max_length
        if not node:
            return 0
        left = dfs(node.left)
        right = dfs(node.right)
        max_length = max(max_length, left + right)
        return max(left, right) + 1

    dfs(root)
    return max_length
```
