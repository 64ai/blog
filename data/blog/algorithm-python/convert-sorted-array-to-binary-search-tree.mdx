## Introduction
Given an integer array `nums` where the elements are sorted in **ascending order**, convert _it to a **height-balanced** binary search tree_.
A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

## Solutions
### 1. insert name
You can just dive right in because the given list is already sorted.
Thanks to list slicing, this problem can be solved efficiently and elegantly. 
By consistently selecting the middle element and recursively slicing the list, 
you can build the binary search tree in a manner similar to traversing it.

```python:main.py
def sorted_array_to_bst(nums: List[int]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
    if not nums:
        return None

    mid = len(nums) // 2
    node = TreeNode(nums[mid])
    node.left = sorted_array_to_bst(nums[:mid])
    node.right = sorted_array_to_bst(nums[mid + 1:])
    return node
```
