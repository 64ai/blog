## Introduction
You are given a network of `n` nodes, labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given `times`,
a list of travel times as directed edges `times[i] = (u(i), v(i), w(i))`, where `u(i)` is the source node,
`v(i)` is the target node, and `w(i)` is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

We will send a signal from a given node `k`.
Return _the **minimum** time it takes for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal_.
If it is impossible for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal, return `-1`.

## Solutions
### 1. Using Dijkstra's algorithm
We will use Dijkstra's algorithm, a classic algorithm for finding the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative weights.

```python:main.py
def network_delay_time(times: List[List[int]], n: int, k: int) -> int:
    # Create the graph as an adjacency list
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for source, destination, travel_time in times:
        graph[source].append((destination, travel_time))

    # Dictionary to track the minimum time to reach each node
    distances = {}

    # Min-heap priority queue to explore the nodes with the shortest known distance first
    priority_queue = [(0, k)]  # (time, node)

    while priority_queue:
        current_time, node = heappop(priority_queue)

        # If the node is not already visited
        if node not in distances:
            distances[node] = current_time
            for neighbor, travel_time in graph[node]:
                arrival_time = current_time + travel_time
                heappush(priority_queue, (arrival_time, neighbor))

    # If all nodes are reached, return the maximum distance, otherwise return -1
    return max(distances.values()) if len(distances) == n else -1
```
