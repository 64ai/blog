## 2024 Google ML Bootcamp Korea
![high-five](/static/images/ai-ml/high-five.gif)
I've been accepted into the [2024 Google ML Bootcamp](https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/google-machine-learning-bootcamp-kr-2024) program!
For the next 4 months starting July 1st, I will be engaging in several exciting tasks.

- Taking the [Deep Learning Specialization Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).
- Competing on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) with the hope of winning prizes.
- Deploying a ML model, writing a tutorial, or building an app using [Gemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma) open model

## Prerequisites
I have a basic understanding of mathematics, including linear algebra, calculus, and probability/statistics. 
However, before the program actually starts, I thought I needed to sharpen my knowledge. When I skimmed through the deep learning course, I felt uncertain about my readiness.
I have just a week to prepare. So, before the bootcamp begins, I plan to complete the book '[Essential Math for Data Science](https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Math-Data-Science-Fundamental/dp/1098102932)' to ensure I can keep up with everything.

## Plan
So, over the next 4 months, I will publish weekly reviews of the bootcamp program, share new things I learn, and provide useful links for those who would like to pursue the same dream as mine.
