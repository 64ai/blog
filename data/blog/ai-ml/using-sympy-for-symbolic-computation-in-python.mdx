[SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/) is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. 
It is a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) 
while keeping the code as simple as possible for comprehensibility and extensibility. 
Whether you are solving algebraic equations, performing calculus, or performing matrix operations, SymPy has you covered.

## Getting Started with SymPy
To get started with SymPy, you'll first need to install it. If you haven't already installed SymPy, you can do so using pip:
```shell:install_sympy
$ pip install sympy
```
Did you install? let's dive right into it.


## Importing SymPy
First, import the necessary modules from SymPy:

```python:main.py
import sympy as sp
```
## Basic Symbolic Operations
### Defining Symbols
Symbols are the basic building blocks in SymPy. You can define symbols using the symbols function:

```python:main.py
x, y, z = sp.symbols('x y z')
```

Now `x`, `y`, and `z` are symbolic variables that can be used in expressions.

### Basic Arithmetic
You can perform arithmetic operations with these symbols just like you would with regular variables:
```python:main.py
expr = x + 2 * y - z
print(expr) # Output: x + 2 * y - z
```

### Expanding and Factoring
SymPy can `expand` and `factor` algebraic expressions. For example:
```python:main.py
expr = (x + y)**2
expanded_expr = sp.expand(expr)
factored_expr = sp.factor(expanded_expr)

print(expanded_expr) # Output: x**2 + 2*x*y + y**2
print(factored_expr) # Output: (x + y)**2
```

### Solving Equations
SymPy can solve equations symbolically. The `solve` function is used for this purpose:
```python:main.py
solution = sp.solve(x ** 2 - 4, x)
print(solution) # Output: [-2, 2]
```

## Calculus with SymPy
### Differentiation
You can compute derivatives using the `diff` function:
```python:main.py
f = x**3 + 2*x**2 + x + 1
f_prime = sp.diff(f, x)
print(f_prime) # Output: 3*x**2 + 4*x + 1
```

### Integration
Similarly, you can perform integration using the `integrate` function:
```python:main.py
f = x**3 + 2*x**2 + x + 1
integral = sp.integrate(f, x)
print(integral) # Output: x**4/4 + 2*x**3/3 + x**2/2 + x
```

### Limits
Calculating limits is straightforward with the `limit` function:
```python:main.py
limit_result = sp.limit(sp.sin(x) / x, x, 0)
print(limit_result) # Output: 1
```

## plot
With the help of [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), you can plot various graphs, charts, and other visualizations.
For instance, this example shows you the 3d representation of the function $$f(x, y) = 2x^3+3y^3$$
```python:main.py
from sympy import *
from sympy.plotting import plot3d

# Declare x and y to SymPy
x, y = symbols('x y')

# Now just use Python syntax to declare function
f = 2 * x ** 3 + 3 * y ** 3

# Calculate the partial derivatives for x and y
dx_f = diff(f, x)
dy_f = diff(f, y)

print(dx_f)  # prints 6*x**2
print(dy_f)  # prints 9*y**2

# plot the function
plot3d(f)
```

## And more!
Beyond the examples shown here, there are many more things you can do with the SymPy library. 
As we go through our AI/ML journey, we will use this powerful tool to assist with various mathematical computations and symbolic reasoning.
