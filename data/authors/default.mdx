Hi there! I’m Alex Noh, a front-end software engineer with a passion for creating user-friendly web applications. Over the years, I’ve mastered the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I firmly believe that a strong foundation is key to success in any field.

Now, I'm diving into the exciting world of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**. While I don't know what I'll become tomorrow, I am committed to continuously learning and exploring what inspires me.

By the way, 6/4 is my wedding anniversary, hence the name of the blog.
